#Overwrite the default Localsettings.php
# FAQ:
# Q: Why isn't this file an overlay that is applied at time of iso generation?
# A: The password in Localsettings is autogenerated at install time.
#    We first need to scrape the value of that password from the existing 
#    LocalSettings files before we overwrite it.
