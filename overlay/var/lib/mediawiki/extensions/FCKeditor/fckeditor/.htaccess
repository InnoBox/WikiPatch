#
# On some specific Linux installations you could face problems with Firefox.
# It could give you errors when loading the editor saying that some illegal
# characters were found (three strange chars in the beginning of the file).
# This could happen if you map the .js or .css files to PHP, for example.
#
# Those characters are the Byte Order Mask (BOM) of the Unicode encoded files.
# All FCKeditor files are Unicode encoded.
#

AddType application/x-javascript .js
AddType text/css .css

#
# If PHP is mapped to handle XML files, you could have some issues. The
# following will disable it.
#

AddType text/xml .xml
